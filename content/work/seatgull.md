title: Seatgull - Software Developer
description: At Seatgull, I helped build tools to make course enrollment and registration easier for students so they could focus on what actually matters. Some of the most popular tools are the schedule generation algorithm - which provides all the different combinations of schedules a student can have based on their preferred classes - and course notifications - which notifies students when a class they're interested in is available.
